/*
	JAValueToString.h
	
	Debugging utility to print the value of (almost) any variable.
	Limitations:
	  * PPC64 is currently not supported (I don’t have the necessary alignment
		information).
	  * Only lvalues can be printed, since it is necessary to take the address
	    of the target.
	  * Function pointers are described as “&<unknown>”, because @encode()
	    describes them as a pointer to “undef”.
	  * Bitfields are not supported, because I’m lazy.
	  * Altivec and SSE vector types are not supported.
	  * Aggregates whose alignment is modified using #pragma pack or similar
	    will not be displayed properly.
	
	These last two are due to compiler limitations - vector types and custom
	aligment aren’t noted in @encode() strings. In these cases, an error string
	is returned (unless you’re calling JAValueToString() directly with 0 as
	expectedSize, in which case a crash is likely).
	
	This utility is not especially robust and should be used for debugging
	only.

/*	JAValueToString(encoding, value, expectedSize)
	
	Interpret the bytes pointed at by <value> as data of the type described
	by <encoding>, in @encode() format.
	
	If the type is one that cannot be parsed correctly, an error string is
	returned. There is no way to distinguish this from a non-error result --
	this is considered acceptable because the only legitimate use of this
	function is to get a display string for debugging purposes.
	
	encoding: a type encoding as produced by the @encode() directive or any
	of various Objective-C runtime methods that return type encodings (such as
	ivar_getTypeEncoding()).
	
	value: a pointer to bytes assumed to match the specified <encoding>.
	
	expectedSize: the byte size of *<value>. This is used to detect certain
	parsing errors. If it is 0, these checks are skipped and a crash may
	result.
